GitLens - shows commit history and authorship details
markdownlint - formatter (and format enforcer) for md files
better comments - highlights comments with alerts, queries, and todos
todo tree - lists todo comments in a file tree (and highlights them, but I like the better commments highlighting more)
github pull requests and issues - just as useful as it sounds, though I'm still figuring out how it works
