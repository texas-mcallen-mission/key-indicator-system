# TODO list

## Things I still need to do in this sprint or soon

1. [x] remove ``dh V2 Holdovers``
2. [ ] Find everything referenced in more than one subsection and move it to commonLib
3. [ ] Move scriptID settings to config or utilize the newer action I created to maneuver the script ID's in github secrets
4. [ ] Make copies of the templates for the demo folder
5. [ ] Take this repository public?
6. [ ] Merge in the fancier version of the CI workflow from the other repo

## Stuff for the future

* should probably rewrite driveHandler to use sheetData, and a object-based system instead of a array-based one that required a workaround / extra code added to sheetData (``sheetData.getIndex("<KEY STRING>")``)
