## importContacts

importContacts is basically the same exact thing that it was when it was originally written back in September or so of 2021.

It does have some changes made by @than2000, but it is super hard-coded and will not handle updates made by external sources well.

If you want to have a good place to cut your teeth on learning how to work with via this system, this is a *really* good place to start.

## notesParser, roleParser

These are super basic, and should probably be rewritten as well.  They were originally broken out during the development back when we were solely using google's built-in AppScript editor.
