// This is my first attempt at writing TypeScript, we'll see how it goes!



// function loadDataTest(): void{
//     let allSheetData = constructSheetData()
//     let zoneSheetData = allSheetData.zoneSheetData

//     let zoneData: any[] = zoneSheetData.getValues()
    
//     Logger.log(zoneData)
    

    
// }


/* FLOW PLAN
Prerequisites:  filesystem structure, KI data & 
* Use MissionOrgData to create reports- add to fs-drivehandler filesystem
* Pull all the data from SheetData, and remove the stuff we don't want seen


* LOAD report templates- this should be done better than last time, and use 
* create copies of the report templates in the correct spots
* store filesystem modifications

* Modify reports - create / update the data in the datasheet- currently this dumps all the data every time
    - I think it should probably stay that way, too- that way in the future I can add the ability to hide old area numbers in the reports
